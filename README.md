==================

Workspace and playground files for a short talk at SwiftWarsaw meetup on 31.07.2014.

First install swift-playground-builder:
    npm install -g swift-playground-builder

Then run with:
    sh build.sh

Enjoy! Just remember that Xcode doesn't like to have multiple playgrounds open - close the current one before opening another.

Thanks to [Jason Sandmeyer (@jas)](https://github.com/jas) and all the contributors to  [swift-playground-builder](https://github.com/jas/swift-playground-builder) for an amazing utility for making Playground documentations.
